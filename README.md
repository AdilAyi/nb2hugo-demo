# nb2hugo demo site

This repository shows how to combine [nb2hugo](https://github.com/vlunot/nb2hugo/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to easily blog with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
The resulting site is available at https://nb2hugo.netlify.com/.

## Structure of the project

The *root* of the repository contains the Netlify configuration files.  
The *base* directory contains a template of the Hugo website.  
The *notebooks* directory contains the Jupyter notebooks.  

New Jupyter notebooks just have to be added to the *notebooks* directory in ordered to be published.

## Detailed information

More detailed information is available in the notebook [Blogging with Jupyter notebooks and Hugo](https://github.com/vlunot/nb2hugo-demo/blob/master/notebooks/blogging-with-jupyter-notebooks-and-hugo/blogging-with-jupyter-notebooks-and-hugo.ipynb).
